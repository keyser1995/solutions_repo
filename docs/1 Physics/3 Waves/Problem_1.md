# **Projectile Motion at 90 Degrees (Vertical Motion)**

## **Introduction**
Projectile motion at an angle of $90^\circ$ refers to purely vertical motion under the influence of gravity. Unlike oblique projectile motion, there is no horizontal displacement, and the motion consists of upward movement until the highest point and then downward free fall.

## **Equations of Motion**
Since the projectile moves only in the vertical direction, the kinematic equations govern its motion. The key variables involved are:

- **Initial velocity**: $u$
- **Final velocity**: $v$
- **Acceleration due to gravity**: $g \approx 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (downward)
- **Time of flight**: $T$
- **Maximum height**: $H$
- **Displacement**: $s$

The standard kinematic equations are:

\[
v = u + at
\]

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s
\]

For projectile motion at $90^\circ$, the acceleration $a$ is replaced by $-g$ (since gravity acts downward).

## **Time of Flight**
The total time taken for the projectile to reach its peak and return to the initial position is called the time of flight. It consists of two phases:

1. **Ascent phase**: The object moves upward until velocity becomes zero.
2. **Descent phase**: The object falls back to the original position.

For the **ascent phase**, at the maximum height, $v = 0$. Using the first equation of motion:

\[
0 = u - g t
\]

Solving for time to reach the maximum height:

\[
t_{\text{up}} = \frac{u}{g}
\]

Since the descent time is equal to ascent time, the total time of flight is:

\[
T = 2 \times \frac{u}{g} = \frac{2u}{g}
\]

## **Maximum Height**
The maximum height $H$ is found using the third equation of motion with $v = 0$ at the peak:

\[
0 = u^2 - 2gH
\]

Solving for $H$:

\[
H = \frac{u^2}{2g}
\]

## **Velocity at Any Time**
The velocity at any instant $t$ during the flight is given by:

\[
v = u - g t
\]

If $t = T = \frac{2u}{g}$, then:

\[
v = u - g \left( \frac{2u}{g} \right) = -u
\]

which indicates that the object returns with the same speed but in the opposite direction.

## **Graphical Representation**
1. **Velocity-Time Graph**: The velocity decreases linearly from $u$ to $0$ at the highest point, then increases in the negative direction until $-u$ at landing.
2. **Displacement-Time Graph**: The displacement increases, reaching a maximum, then decreases symmetrically.
3. **Acceleration-Time Graph**: A constant value of $-g$ throughout the motion.

## **Conclusion**
Projectile motion at $90^\circ$ is a special case of vertical motion where:
- The horizontal displacement is zero.
- The time of flight depends only on the initial velocity.
- The maximum height is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
- The velocity changes symmetrically about the highest point.

This motion is fundamental in understanding free-fall motion and applications like rocketry, vertical throws, and gravitational acceleration experiments.
