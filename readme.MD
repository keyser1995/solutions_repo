# Projectile Motion Simulation

This project simulates the range of a projectile as a function of the launch angle, considering the initial velocity and gravitational acceleration.

## Files
- `projectile_motion.py`: Python script that calculates and plots the range vs. angle.
- `README.md`: Information about the project.

## How to run
- Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib`
- Run the script: `python projectile_motion.py`
